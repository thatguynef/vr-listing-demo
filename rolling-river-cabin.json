For guests who would love to experience Blue Ridge to the fullest or for those who just want a quiet little getaway, Rolling River Cabin provides that special mountain oasis you are looking for. Even though this Blue Ridge cabin is 4 bedrooms/3 baths and can accommodate 10 guests, it presents quite cozily for a couple or a small family. Beautifully appointed interiors and large spacious covered porches each with a wood-burning fireplace overlooking the rushing waters of the Toccoa River, you will experience peace and a contentment you constantly yearn for. Start your day sipping your coffee and watching the sun rise over the sparkling waters of the Toccoa River and the geese that love to perch on the Cherokee Indian Fish Trap. With so many things to do, you can start by a short hike down to the river's edge and set up a lawn chair to enjoy the rushing river. A favorite among kids is to take your tubes down and use a ski rope to tie up to the tree so you can float around in the river without traveling! If you want to \"travel\" down the river, enjoy a two-hour float into McCaysville's Horseshoe Bend Park depending on the water level. Since you're just less than 10 minutes away from the park, you can leave a car or go pick up your party. For the fishermen in your group, contact Toccoa River Outfitters and they will give you a wade or float trip of your dreams right from your cabin and the area. They know where all the honey spots are where the trout like to hide and your fishing efforts will be richly rewarded with that trophy rainbow trout or brownie. If you want to venture away from the cabin, the famous Mercier Orchards is just down the road towards Blue Ridge, as well as Bear Claw Vineyards where relaxation is fun!

For the outdoor thrills the Ocooee Whitewater Center offers whitewater rafting as well as hiking trails and walk paths, another favorite local hangout. In the warm months, enjoy swimming by the big rocks and find deep swimming holes. After working up an appetite at the end of the day, enjoy many of Blue Ridge's popular restaurants, wine bars, or breweries where live music can be found, or come back to the cabin and enjoy preparing a special meal to share indoors, or dine al fresco with a river backdrop.
